# Challenge 1

## **Description**

Week one challenge focused on accessibility. We were provided starter code that was fully functioning but not accessible due to the lack of semantic HTML elements.

### **How** 

I made the code accessible by replacing the multiple 'div' elements with proper semantic HTML elements. ex: replacing 'div' with 'section' or 'aside'. 

### **Why**

By using the proper semantic HTML elements it helps search engines and other user devices to understand the importance and context of what is on the page. Code that uses semantic elements offers a better user experience and is much easier for other developers to read.

### **What I Learned**

During this challenge I learned the importance of semantic HTML elements and how they make code more accessible. I also learned what semantic HTML tags are most appropriate for each block of code.
